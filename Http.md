# What is HTTP and how it works?
Everyone must have seen this word, when you are using browser to open a web page. The very first word http (hyper text transfer protocol), everytime you use when browser sends request and recieve responces on internet, more generalized sentence when you open a web page. Http propotocal defines how information going to be formatted and transmitted over the network.

When user click on the link, or type something on browser address bar, http sends request to server and server evaluates the request and return responce back to client (in this case client is browser).
