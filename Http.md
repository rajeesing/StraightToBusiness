# What is HTTP and how it works?
Everyone must have seen this word, when you are using browser to open a web page. The very first word http (hyper text transfer protocol), everytime you use when browser sends request and recieve responces on internet, more generalized sentence when you open a web page. Http propotocal defines how information going to be formatted and transmitted over the network.

When user click on the link, or type something on browser address bar, http sends request to server and server evaluates the request and return responce back to client (in this case client is browser).

HTTP (**H**yper **T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) - If you seprate Transfer word from here you get two words that need to understand. **Protocol** which means set to rules which tells how the two different entities (computers) communicates with each other and **Hypertext** is simply a text which refers or redirect to another text or web document. That might be more that just hypertext in today's world but take this as is defined back in the days.
